# Time Series Transformer for Predicting Missing Data

## Abstract

This paper implements an existing transformer-based approach for predicting missing values in time series data. We demonstrate that transformers, traditionally used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Computer Vision (CV), can be effectively adapted to the time series domain to impute missing data. Our method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, consistently achieving superior accuracy compared to conventional imputation techniques.
